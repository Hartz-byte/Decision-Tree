# Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifiers

This repository contains two implementations of Decision Tree and Random Forest models for solving classification problems. One implementation is done using the scikit-learn library for convenience and efficiency, while the other implementation is done from scratch to understand the core mechanics of these algorithms.

The dataset used for this project is the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning, where the task is to classify the species of a flower based on its attributes like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Additionally, a Mushroom Classification problem is included, where the task is to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its features.

## Key Features:
- Decision Tree Classifier: Builds a tree-like model of decisions based on the dataset's features.
- Random Forest Classifier: Combines multiple decision trees to create a stronger and more robust model.
- Data Visualizations: Visualized the decision tree structure and feature importance in Random Forest.
- Model Comparison: Compared the performance of both models in terms of accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- From Scratch Implementation: An implementation of a mushroom classification problem done from scratch to show a deeper understanding of model construction.

## Decision Tree Classifier with scikit-learn:
In this section, a Decision Tree Classifier is trained using the Iris dataset. We visualize the tree and evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The decision tree is also visualized to understand how decisions are being made.

## Random Forest Classifier with scikit-learn:
The Random Forest Classifier combines multiple decision trees to create a robust ensemble model. We compare its performance with the Decision Tree using various metrics.

## Visualizations
- Decision Tree Visualization: We plot the tree structure to show how decisions are made at each node.
- Feature Importance: For Random Forest, we plot the importance of different features to show which ones contribute the most to the model's decision-making process.
- Accuracy Comparison: A bar chart is used to compare the accuracy of both models.
